# sakuraSoftware
Sakura Software was the first ever full-stack website that I had ever made. This was initially for my Internet Applications and Databases module for university. 
I **really** loved this module, already knowing HTML, CSS, and Javascript but had never taken the time to figure out how to really make it *work*.

Some of the features of this application include:
  + A search function, that displays the relevant data
  + Security features - form validation, hash passwords, handling injections.
  + Some features are only accessed from logged-in accounts

## What I Would Change!
This project is probably very rough around the edges, but for my very first try, I don't think it was *that* bad. 
I'm sure there's a much better way to go about logged-in users having access to certain features, in the project I copied pages and changed what I needed to on each page. (That'll make more sense looking at the pages).
There were also a few functionality aspects that were asked for but not given such as ensuring that all dates the user inserted aren't in the future as well as another security feature. 

Overall I was happy with the project!

## How can I see the project? 
Well! 
1. You can (probably) copy the code, insert the SQL database, and try running it for yourself locally *or*
2. Hopefully soon, you can visit it online. (Once I've gotten around to hosting it myself ;) )
